\begin{abstract}
This solution paper is part of the course 'Numerical Recipes in Astrophysics'. The code introduction section will explain briefly some additional details on the code that are not shown/explained in the other sections and how the general code lay-out of each question looks like. Section one will discuss the random number generator that has been used throughout the paper and the goodness of it. Section 2 will use this RNG for the creation of a Gaussian random field with the use of inverse fourier transforms. Afterwards, the linear growth factor that is introduced in cosmology is found as a function of time with the use of a numerical ODE solver. Section 4 explains how a simulation can be made of the initial conditions of the Universe, following with section 5 which looks in more detail in mass assignment schemes. With the use of logistic regression, $\gamma$-ray burst are classified in section 6. Then finally a Barnes-Hut quadtree is build for 1200 particles, where the masses and positions were given.
